This is a great graph. It requires very little effort to understand what it depicts, the colors are distinct without clashing, and the labels and title are very clear. There is a bit of bias in the x-axis, as starting it at the 60% point could trick the viewer into thinking that South Asia had zero literacy in the 1980s; however,  it is not difficult to understand the axis cutoff. The only recommendations I can make are increasing the font sizes for the title, axis labels and values, and the legend. Perhaps adding a ‘figtext’ line that includes the source of the data might be helpful, but it is by no means necessary for this assignment. Overall, great job!
