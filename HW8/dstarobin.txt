Aesthetically, this graph is great. There is a lot of information presented in a small space, but it’s all useful and illustrates the point of the graph very well.  The color palette is not distracting, and stacking the plots makes it easy to understand the differences between the two observed months.  I also like that there are explanations for three of the dips in ridership. The only recommendation I would offer is to plot the Rides on the y-axis in the log scale (or perhaps a broken axis) so that the viewer can see the daily fluctuations in customer rides; at this scale, January Customer Rides does not look like much more than a mostly straight line.
