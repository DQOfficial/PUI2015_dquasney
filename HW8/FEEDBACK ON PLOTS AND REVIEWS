youre reviewes were insightful and on point 10/10


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
==================

the plot is largely empty: remove empty space at bottom and plot

the grid should extend for the full extent of the plot

all in all it is a good simple plot

colors are confused by color-blind viewers


NOTE ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===============================

==========
very nice plot that summarize a lot of details at once

labels in the legend top left too small to read

nice unobtrusive labels showing single events

drop rides from the labels on the right for compactness


consider a more compact notation for the y axis: e.g. use units of 1000 rides

===========


typical plot in finance: complies to tufte's idea of small multiples
nice seaborn plot that conveys a lot of info at once.


x, y labels should be spelled out, not a variable name with an underscore

labels too small

the fit line cannot be seen over the points. consider a different color or remove the points inside the contours (which are redundant and blended anyways)


ortrune
========
thick lines are not necessary and cause ambiguity when thy overlap

the datapoints are sparse: the plot could be compressed on the x axis and this would aid comparison

tick labels are on he small side, but not terribly small 

color blindness compliant
