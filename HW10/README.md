Please be sure to re-run the notebook before grading. 

I had write the code on a Mac because geopandas does not work on my Windows machine but then
had to upload it back to Windows before pushing it to GitHub. I accidentally ran the notebook while 
reviewing the code, so it generated errors and broke everything. It worked just fine on the Mac with 
geopandas.
